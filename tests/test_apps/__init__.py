"""
This subpackage is used by the test suite to store test application modules
that are dynamically imported during testing. The conftest.py fixture
'test_apps' adds this directory to the Python path to allow importing
test applications as needed.

This __init__.py file is intentionally kept empty to make this directory
a valid Python package.
